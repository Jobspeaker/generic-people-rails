# Declare your gem's dependencies in generic_people_rails.gemspec.
# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and
# development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.

# BUG INTRODUCED BY WYCATS (Yes, Yehuda, again) means that you need to put
# your dependencies redundantly in this file.
